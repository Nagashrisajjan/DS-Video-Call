Hi Everyone,
To use our project, you need Visual Studio Code and Django. Our code is written in Python, and for web implementation, we use Django as the presentation application.
Extract our code and run it in Visual Studio Code. With the help of Django, you can easily get a web interface.
ThankÂ you.
